# Introduction to Deep Learning For Image Analysis - Winter 2022

This weekly workshop is for anyone interested in learning how to create deep learning algorithms for their image analysis projects. Over 8 weeks, we will cover the building blocks of convolutional neural networks, handling image data, and common problems seen in biological image data sets. Participants should have a working knowledge of python and a basic understanding of statistics. 

* **Format**: Weekly in-person 1 1/2 hour sessions, Mondays 2:00-3:30 PM - a remote connection will be available for those who cannot attend in person.

* **Eligibility**: Open to everyone in the UO community with experience in python and basic knowledge of statistics, guests of the UO community may join with instructor approval. There is a 30 person cap for students available on a first-come basis.  

* **Cost**: As we continue to build our workshop series, all costs are currently covered by generous support from UO's Data Science Initiative and the Knight Campus Bio-informatics Internship Program.
