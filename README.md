# Getting Started with Talapas
This workshop will be run on [Talapas](https://hpcf.uoregon.edu/content/talapas), UO's supercomputer, which has all the needed software and data. We'll be utilizing [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks hosted through OpenOnDemand. Start by pointing your browser to https://talapas-ln2.uoregon.edu, and login using your talapas credentials.
